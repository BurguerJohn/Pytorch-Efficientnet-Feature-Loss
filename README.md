# Pytorch-Efficientnet-Feature-Extraction
Extract features and calculate Loss between images from EfficientNet using pytorch.

A simple script to calculate Loss from features using pytorch Efficientnet:
https://pytorch.org/vision/master/_modules/torchvision/models/efficientnet.html

You may need to install pytorch 1.10 so torchvision can find the model.

Based on Feature Loss scripts from VGG19

The script is simple enough to me edited to other purposes.
